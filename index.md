# Background
I started out in software development writing NeXTStep apps.  Then transitioned to WebObjects development for several years.  Shortly before taking a break from the software industry, I contributed to an opensource content management system called Magnolia.  Somewhere in all time that I worked for MusicMobs to develop a playlist sharing site with associated client software.

After that phase, I combined my interest in foreign langugages with an interest in teaching and took up teaching English as a foreign language.  This lead to me persuing a career as an elementary teacher.  I completed a masters program, got my teaching license, and taught first grade for two years.

Now I'm intersted in returning to software development which I feel combines my interests in learning with writing and problem solving.

# My Interests
I'm currently interested in docker, golang, text-based interfaces, and cryptography.

# My Projects
I'm currently looking at and learning about the charmbracelet suite of apps and packages.
